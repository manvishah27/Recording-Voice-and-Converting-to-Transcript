# Recording-Voice-and-Converting-to-Transcript
Students, academics and researchers, journalists, and even people who attend a lot of meetings and need to keep everything organised end up with a long transcription queue and spend a lot of time writing notes and transcripts. Our normal workflow to deal with this has been to keep the audio file playing in the background, as we type in a text editor. There are a couple of obvious problems with this - for one, things like pausing and moving back and forward are needlessly complicated as you move between programs, and for another, controlling playback speed to suit your typing speed isn't easy either. In short, it's a really bad workflow. As a result, we're always on the lookout for a good app that can solve this problem because it would make life a lot easier - in one instance where we actually resorted to getting someone to help transcribe a book's worth of lecture notes.
